# VHDL Multiplier with Overflow and Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in VHDL code, specifically in handling potential integer overflows during arithmetic operations. The provided example showcases a simple multiplier that lacks error handling for overflow situations. An improved version with better error handling is provided as a solution. 

## Bug Description
The initial VHDL code performs unsigned integer multiplication using the `UNSIGNED` type.  It fails to address situations where the result of the multiplication exceeds the range of the `UNSIGNED` type, leading to silent overflow. 

## Solution
The solution demonstrates improved error handling by explicitly checking the multiplication result for potential overflow before assigning it to the output.  This prevents unexpected behavior and makes the design more robust.
